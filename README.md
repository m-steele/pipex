# pipex
simulate piping commands

This is a project for 42 to build a program that simulates pipes from the terminal commands. As it is, you have to use access() to get the commands from the environment you are working in (PATH)and implement functions such as fork(), pipe(), dup2(), wait(), etc... to create the parent and child processes.
